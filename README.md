# The-Cube

An interactive 3D cube built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, showcasing real-time rotation, hover effects, and user-driven controls. Perfect as a portfolio piece or UI/UX demo, it demonstrates mastery of modern CSS transforms, animations, and event-driven scripting.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time 3D Rotation**  
  Smooth, continuous cube spinning controlled via **mouse drag** or **arrow keys**.

- **Face Interactivity**  
  Hover states and click handlers on each face to trigger callbacks or display custom content.

- **CSS-Only Perspective & Animation**  
  Leverages `transform: perspective()`, `rotateX()`, `rotateY()`, and `@keyframes` for performant visuals without external libraries.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Automatically scales and recenters on any viewport, from desktop monitors to mobile screens.

- **Modular & Extensible**  
  Clean, well-commented codebase—easily add new faces, textures, or integrate into larger web apps.
